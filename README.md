#Three column preview card component.

Here i have created a three column preview card that has three columns of different colors. My approach here was to create a card container that holds three different cards as different colored columns. On desktop screens, the card container has a display of flex which stacks all three of its different sub cards as a row. However as soon as the screen size reduces to 700px or below, the card container switches to a flex direction of columns thereby displaying each individual cards stacked on top of one another as a one big column. One issue i have faced here was the overflowing of the buttons inside the individual sub cards. I fixed this by giving them a minimum width of 225 pixels so that their width remains the sane thereby preventing the buttons from spilling outside the card dimensions. For active states of the individual buttons, i have added hover pseudo classes to each of them as well. For responsiveness i have added a media query with max width of 700px that will enable the working of some of the CSS properties that i have set only for screen sizes below 700px.
