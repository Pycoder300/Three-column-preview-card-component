# Three-column preview card component.

Here I have created a three-column preview card that has three columns of different colors. My approach here was to create a card container that holds three different cards as different colored columns. On desktop screens, the card container has a display of flex which stacks all three of its different sub-cards as a row. However, as soon as the screen size reduces to 700px or below, the card container switches to a flex-direction of columns thereby displaying each individual card stacked on top of one another as one big column. One issue I have faced here was the overflowing of the buttons inside the individual sub-cards. I fixed this by giving them a minimum width of 225 pixels so that their width remains the same thereby preventing the buttons from spilling outside the card dimensions. For active states of the individual buttons, I have added hover pseudo-classes to each of them as well. For responsiveness, I have added a media query with a max width of 700px that will enable the working of some of the CSS properties that I have set only for screen sizes below 700px.
